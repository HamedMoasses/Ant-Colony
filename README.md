# Ant-Colony
Swarm Intelligence (AI)


Evolutionary algorithms derived from the ant colony algorithm are a subset of the "Swarm Intelligence" methods.
These methods are the field of research and study that studies the algorithms inspired by the concept of "Swarm Behaviors". 
Crowded intelligence algorithms consist of a set of simple individual entities that interact with each other through "self-organizing."
Self-organization means the lack of a central control system to control and coordinate the members of a crowded intelligence system.

Applications of the ant colony algorithm:

Optimizing routing in computer networks-

Job-Scheduling Problems Optimization Strategies-

Optimizing vehicle routing-

Image Processing-

Issues of optimizing device size in the physical design of nanoelectronic devices-

Antenna shape optimization (for example in RF-ID tags)-

Classification-

and Data Mining.

In this repository we use ACO to optimize 4 famous problems including TSP, Binary Knapsack, Integer Knapsack and Quadratic Assignment Problem.
comments within codes is been provided line by line.
